<p>The <b>Home</b> tab on the <i>Net12NMR</i> ribbon mostly contains items used to control the
display of NMR files and the graphical user interface (GUI).</p>
<p>The &quot;Y-Scale&quot; pane is used to specify the Y-expansion of the data. Three button
re-normalize, scale-up and scale-down the Y-expansion of the current document. The three checkboxes
are used to select where the anchor is for this change in scale. Most of the time, Fourier-transformed
(FT) data will be anchored on the &quot;Bottom&quot;, while free-induction data (FID) should probably
use the &quot;Middle&quot;.</p>
<p> The &quot;View&quot; pane controls which elements of the <i>Net12NMR</i> GUI are displayed.
Check boxes for the NMR <b>File Explorer</b>, Color <b>Properties</b>, the <b>Output</b> windows,
the <b>Status Bar</b>, NMR <b>File Info</b> and NMR file <b>Parameters</b>are gobal settings that
remember their state from session to session. <b>Peak Labels</b> and <b>Integrals</b> are local NMR
file view parameters that are initialized to checked when the file is first displayed.</p>
<p>The &quot;Axis&quot; pane contains five buttons to control the display units for theNMR axis. The
default unit for FID data is &quot;Time&quot; while the default unit for FT data is &quot;PPM&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;Window&quot; pane is used to manage the document windows.</p>
<p>The &quot;File&quot; pane contains a button for copying the current document to the Windows&trade;
clipboard. The clipboard will contain not only a metafile of the display window, but also the text
representation of the x-y data. Another button in this pane is used to reload the file and is useful
for starting over with an NMR document. The final button in this pane will play the FID on your
PC. The FID will be converted to a WAV file and played over the default multimedia channel. The
real data points will be played over the left channel and the imaginary data points will be played
over the right channel.</p>
<p>The &quot;Info&quot; pane contains a single button to display an About dialog, showing the version
number and copyright information.</p>
