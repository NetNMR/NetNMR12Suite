<body>
<p>The <b>Quick Access Toolbar at the top of the <i>Net12NMR</i> main window</b> is a place where frequently used
commands are always available. It can be customized by the user by clicking on over-scored down arrow just
to the right of the last command and selecting <b>More Commands...</b>.</p>
<p>In the <b>Customize</b> dialog, select a set of command by selecting an area from the &quot;Chose commands
from:&quot; drop-down selection. <b>Only choose commands</b> that are represented by a small black background
icon. These are the only commands that can be executed at any time. Many of the commands on the various tabs
of the ribbon bar are only appicable <b>while that ribbon bar tab is displayed</b>. Most of the commands which
may be useful to install on the quick access toobar are in the <a href="ribbon_tab_home.htm">Home Tab</a>,
and the <a href="menu_file.htm">File</a> menu.</p>
