<p>The &quot;Shelf&quot; is a holding area for region storage for the <a href="ribbon_tab_baseline.htm">Baseline</a>,
<a href="ribbon_tab_peaks.htm">Peak Picking</a> and <a href="ribbon_tab_integral.htm">Integral</a> processing tabs.
While the region information for these three processes are stored as integer from-to indexes, from-to regions on the
Shelf are stored in PPM values. This allows you to use a process shelf from one spectrum and apply those same
regions to another spectrum, even if the data was collected with a different offset or spectrum width.</p>
<p>The <b>Status</b> pane is a read-only pane that display the number of baseline, peak and integral regions
currently on the shelf.</p>
<p>When you select the Shelf tab, the &quot;Shelf&quot; tab of the <a href="output_window.htm">Output Window</a>
will be automatically displayed. This tab of the Output Window shows the entire contents of the shelf in a format
consistent with the ASCII form of the Shelf.</p>
<p>The <b>Clear Shelf</b> pane contains buttons for clearing the shelf of baseline regions, peak thresholds and
integral regions. Clearing the shelf of these items will not clear any regions of open <i>Net12NMR</i>
documents.</p>
<p>The <b>Storage</b> pane containes buttons to save the shelf to an ASCII file, or load saved shelf data to
<i>Net12NMR</i>. Since the processing shelf is stored as an ASCII file you can edit it once it has been saved.</p>
<p>The format for the shelf ASCII file is simple. Each line describes a region with either three or four parameters.
The parameters are separated by white-space. The first parameter is a single upper case letter, &quot;B&quot;,
&quot;P&quot; or &quot;I&quot; for a baseline, peak-picking or integral region, respectively. The next two parameters
are the from-to region in PPM units. Baseline regions have no forth parameter while the fourth parameter for a
peak-picking region is the height of the peak threshold for that region, expressed as a fraction of the full range
of the dataset. If a fourth parameter is specified for an integral range, the spectrum integral is normalized with
that value and so can be any real value greater than zero. Specifying more than one forth parameter for an integral
region will result in just one normalization that is choosen by the software.</p>
<p>The <b>Save Shelf</b> command button will prompt you for a filename and location.</p>
<p>Reading a shelf file with the <b>Load Shelf</b> button will clear any previous contents of the shelf.</p>
