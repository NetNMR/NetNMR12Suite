<p>Integral regions are set and cleared using the zoom cursors. You can first set the zoom cursors around a region
you want to integrate and the press the mouse context button and select the <b>Add Integral</b> or <b>Clear
Integral</b> menu item. A short-cut also exists for setting and clearing integrals: Hold down The Shift or Control
key while setting the zoom cursors to respectively set or clear an integral region.</p>
<p>Integrals in a spectrum can be normalized to any value by moving the cross-hairs cursor to a current integral
region and clicking the mouse context button and then selecting the <b>Set Integral</b> menu item. You will then
be promted for a value. Once set, this will set the global integral constant within this session of <i>Net12NMR</i>.
Any NMR files opened subsequently will use this integration constant to display any integrals. Also, when you set
an integral value, <i>Net12NMR</i> will remember the exact index of the right edge of the integral region that
you used to set the integation constant.</p>
<p>Command buttons in the <b>Choose Integral</b> pane on this ribbon tab will set and clear integral regions of the
active spectrum. The <b>Add Integral</b> and the <b>Remove Integral</b> buttons operate on the region of the displayed
spectrum between the zoom cursors. The <b>Clear All Integrals</b> will remove all integral regions of the current
spectrum, even if those region are outside the current displayed area.</p>
<p>Internally, <i>Net12NMR</i> always calculates integrals from the actual floating point values in the spectrum
array. The displayed integral values are modified by multiplying by a normalization constant that is alway greater
than zero. There are two normalization constants that can be used to display the values of the integrals, a local
normalization constant and a global normalization constant. The global normalization constant is initialized to 
1.0 at the start of each <i>Net12NMR</i> session. The local normalization constant is a <i>Net12NMR</i> data file
paramater stored with each .nmrx file and is initialized to 1.0 when the file is first created. A checkbox in the
&quot;Normalization&quot; pane allows you to choose which normalization constant to use. This checkbox is a
<b>Net12NMR</b> file parameter, so changing this checkbox will mark the file as having changed.(Even if you return
to the original state the, the file will still be marked as having changed.) There are also button in this
pane to copy the normalization constants back and forth and they will automatically check or uncheck the <b>Use
Global</b> checkbox. These buttons will only be active when you are using the &quot;copy from&quot; normalization
constant. These button will not be active if the two normalization constants are equal.</p>
<p>You can copy the integral regions to and from the <a href="ribbon_tab_shelf.htm">Processing Shelf</a> with the
two command buttons in the <b>Process Shelf</b> pane. Ordinarily, an integral Process Shelf item has only two
numeric values, the PPM values of the integral region. However, if the index of the right most point of a integral
region corresponds to the value that was used to set the current integration constant, that integral Processing
Shelf item will have a third numeric value that is its integration value. If you pull the integral regions from
the Processing Shelf, then the global integration constant will be set to five the same integral over that
region.</p>
<p>Selecting this tab on the Ribbon will automatically select the &quot;Integral&quot; tab of the
<a href="output_window.htm">Output Window</a>.</p>
