<p>The &quot;Process&quot; pane contains buttons and other items for most of the basic process commands.</p>
<p><b>Truncate</b> will shrink the data size to the largest power of two that is smaller than the current data size.
This is useful when the acquired data acquisition time was too long.</p>
<p><b>DC Level</b>  will subtract averagse determined by the left-most points of the FID from the real and imaginary
FIDs. With a properly functioning spectrometer this is usually not necesssary, but can remove a center, carrier spike,
if present.</p>
<p><b>Quad Correct</b> is usually not necessary but will re-orthoganalize the acquired FID if carrier images show up
in the FT spectrum.</p>
<p><b>Left</b> and <b>Right Shift</b> will move the FID to the left or right by one point causing a zero point to be
appended on the opposite side. Usually only useful for certain kinds of solid-state NMR data.</p>
<p><b>Apodize</b> will apply a window to the FID specified by the three drop-down selections next to the button.
The applied shape can be either &quot;Lorentzian&quot; or &quot;Gaussian&quot;. The numerical value is selected in the
next drop-down selection. Values other than the current drop-down values can be entered via the keyboard. Negative
values are allowed. Use some percaution. Use of negative values that are larger in magnitude that tne narrowest line
in the data will result in trashed data. Broad-tailed Lorentzian line-shapes can be replaces with narrow-tailed
Gaussian lineshapes by apodizing twice, first with a gentle negative Lorentzian apodization and then with a gentle
positive gaussian apodization. Finally the units of the numerical value is specified with the third drop-down selection.
&quot;Hertz&quot; is usually chosen for solution spectra while &quot;PPM&quot; is usually used for 
solid-state spectra.</p>
<p><b>Zero Fill</b> will grow the data set to the smallest power of two that is greater then the current size of the
data.</p>
<p><b>Fourier Transform</b> will transform time (FID) data to frequency (spectrum) data. The Global Phase Correction
is also applied to the new Fourier-transformed spectrum.</p>
<p><b>Audio Filter Comp</b> will correct older, non-digital NMR spectrum data for audio filter drop near the edges
of the spectrum.</p>
<p>The &quot;Phase&quot; pane is used for phasing Fourier-transformed data.</p>
<p><b>Magnitude</b> will produce a phase-independent magnitude mode spectrum. This command is only useful for spectra
that simply cannot be properly phased.</p>
<p><b>Zero Phase</b> will set the current global phase correction to zero and apply that correction to the current
document.</p>
<p><b>At Cursors</b> will perform an operator-assisted manual phase of the current spectrum. Start by placing the zoom
cursors on two realatively large peaks near the left and right edge of the spectum. These two points will become the
anchor points and adjustment points when manual phasing starts. After pressing the
<b>At Cursors</b>button, the display will change.
A single cursor will show where the active point in the spectrum is. Moving the mouse up and down will change the phase of
this point while keeping the phase constant at the location of the other cursor (hidden for the moment).
The non-active cursor location becomes the anchor point and is essentially the fulcrum of a
see-saw, while the active point moves that part of the see-saw up and down. Click the select mouse button to
switch cursors, hiding the active cursor and showing the other cursor, where the anchor point. Continue phasing with the mouse,
now at the other cursor. You can expand the vertical with the mouse wheel or
use the context menu to select another command. Iterate from the left fulcrum point to the right until satisfied.
When done type a &quot;c&quot; on the keyboard (or select the approprite command from the context menu). The mouse
wheel can be used to change the veritical expansion of the display. It is generally a good idea to highly expand the
vertical scale when adjusting the phase. It makes it easier to judge a pure absorption spectrum by looking at the
baseline region near a peak being phase. Holding down the &lt;CONTROL&gt; key will instead alter the spectrum vertical
offset (the DC-level) so that the baseline region can be better viewed in the case of very high vertical expansion.
</p>
<p><b>Autophase A&amp;B</b> will perform an autophase, trying to optimize by the constant (&quot;A&quot;) and linear
(&quot;B&quot;) phase correction of the spectrum.</p>
<p><b>Autophase A Only</b></p> will set the linear (&quot;B&quot;) phase to zero and optimize the constant
(&quot;A&quot;) phase correction.
<p><b>Invert Phase</b> will increment the constant phase correction by 180&deg;.</p>
<p>Controls in the <b>Manual Phase Correct</b> pane is used to manually change the constant or linear phase values. Choose a
magnitude of &quot;10&quot;, &quot;1&quot; or &quot;0.1&quot; degrees and choose which term (&quot;Const&quot; or
&quot;Linear&quot;) and push the <b>Increment</b> or <b>Decrement</b> to add or subtract the selected value to the
selected term.</p>
<p>Please note that phasing commands in both the <b>Phase</b> and the <b>Manual Phase Correct</b> panes operate on the
current active spectrum and the resulting phase becomes the new Global Phase Correction.</p>
