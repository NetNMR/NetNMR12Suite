<p><b>Setting the Zoom Cursors</b></p>
<p>In <i>Net12NMR</i>, the mouse controls the cross-hairs cursor. The position of this cursor is tracked
in the <a href="statusbar.htm">status bar</a>.</p>
<p>The position of the <b>zoom cursors</b> are set with mouse: Click down (with the mouse select button)
where you want the first zoom cursor and then (while still holding down the mouse select button) move
the cross-hairs cursor where you want the other zoom cursor and then let up on the mouse select button.
While you are holding the button down, you can move to the right <b>or</b> the left, it doesn't matter.
Several command in <i>Net12NMR</i> require zoom cursors to be set and so these commands will not be
executable until they are.</p>
<p>Once set, the zoom cursors may be &quot;nudged&quot; to the left or right with the keyboard arrow
keys. You can also cause the right zoom cursor to step halfway to the left cursor with the <b>h</b>
key on the keyboard.</p>
<p><b>Selecting (or Clearing) a Region</b></p>
<p><a href="ribbon_tab_baseline.htm">Baseline correction</a>,
<a href="ribbon_tab_peaks.htm">peak-bicking</a> and <a href="ribbon_tab_integral.htm">integration</a>
are three activities that use regions of the spectrum that are set or cleared with the zoom cursors.
For all three of these activities, a short cut exists that allows you to set or clear a region
of the spectrum. Ordinarly, you set the zoom cursors around a region in the spectrum you want to set
or clear and the click the context mouse button to bring up a floating menu that contains commands
to set or clear a region. You can hold down the &lt;SHIFT&gt; or &lt;CONTROL&gt;-key while you are
placing the zoom cursors to set or clear a spectrum region.</p>
<p><b>The Power of the Mouse Wheel!</b></p>
<p>Almost any time, the vertical expansion of <i>Net12NMR</i> is connected to the <b>mouse wheel</b>.
Each click of the wheel will expand or contract the vertical depending on the direction the mouse
wheel is moved. The makes the up and down arrow commands controlling the vertical expansion on the
<a href="ribbon_tab_home.htm">Home tab</a> mostly redundant.</p>
