three tabs will be display automatically when clicking on the <a href="ribbon_tab_peaks.htm">Peaks</a>,
<a href="ribbon_tab_integral.htm">Integral</a> and <a href="ribbon_tab_shelf.htm">Shelf</a> Ribbon tabs.</p>
<p>Each output tab will display a header line to indicate the values of each item in each subsequent line.
While this header line can be seleted, its selection has no effect on any subsequent command in that window.
Once a peak or integral is selected in either of the output windows, these items will show up in a highighted
color on the display. The color can be adjusted by the user in the <a href="properties_window.htm">Properties
Window</a>.</p>
<p>Each output tab has a specifc context menu:</p>
<p>The <a href="ribbon_tab_peaks.htm">Peaks</a> output window contains a menu command for setting the offset
of a selected peak. If more than one peak is selected, this command will be disabled. Selected peaks, or the
entire <b>Peaks</b> tab can be copied to the clipboard with other commands in the context menu. The header
line will always also be copied to the clibpoard.</p>
<p>The <a href="ribbon_tab_integral.htm">Integral</a> output window contains a context menu command for setting
the integrtion value. Either a single integral can be selected or multiple integrals selected. If multiple
integrals are selected, the sum of the selected integrals will be used to set the integral constant. Context
commands can also copy or delete selected integrals or all integrals.</p>
<p>The <a href="ribbon_tab_shelf.htm">Shelf</a> output window contains context menu command for copying the
