<p>In the <b>Linear></b> pane of this panel, the <b>Level</b> button will do a simple linear baseline correction
of the currently displayed region of the current spectrum. Note that this can be a sub section of the entire spectrum.
<b>Level</b> will use 1/32nd (or a minimum of two points at each end of the displayed region to calcualte a linear
correction to the spectrum. Any undisplayed portion of the spectrum will not be affected by this command.</p>
<p><b>Zero</b> will zero the point of the spectrum between the zoom cursors. Use with respect with regard to 
scientific integrity.</p>
<p>Once this <b>Baseline Tab</b> is slected, the display will change. The spectrum information and parameters are
hidden and a current baseline is drawn. The <b>Choose Baseline</b> pane has commands to select which portion of the
current spectrum to use in the baseline correction calculation. The current baseline is drawn in two colors. By
default regions of the spectrum that are assigned to the baseline are drawn in red while region of the spectrum
which are not in the baseline (and are to be ignored) are draw in grey, although the user can change these
color assignments. Initially the entire spectrum is included in the baseline. To remove a region, put the zoom
cursors around the region and presss the <b>Remove Baseline</b> button. To add a region back into the baseline,
put the zoom cursors around that region and press the <b>Add Baseline</b> button. A short-cut exists for these
two actions. Simply select a region of the spectrum with the zoom cursors <i>while holding down the SHIFT key</i>
to remove a region of the baseline or <i>hold down the CONTROL key</i> to add a region to the baseline.</p>
<p><b>Reset</b> will reinitialize the baseline to include the entire spectrum.</p>
<p>You can use commands in the <b>Auto Find</b> pane to automatically determine which regions of the spectrum to
include in the baseline calclation and which to exclude. The <b>S/N</b> parameter specifies the minimum
signal-to-noise to use in detecting possible peaks in the spectrum. A value of &quot;7&quot; is a good place to
start for most spectra. <b>Width</b> specifies the number of points around a found peak that will automatically
be excluded from the baseline. A value of &quot;120&quot; is a good value for most high resolution spectra.</p>
<p><b>Auto Find</b> button will then use the <b>Width</b> and <b>S/N</b> parameters to find the baseline in the
current spectra. Once the selection is close, you can use the manual commands in the <b>Choose Baseline</b>
pane to fine-tune your selection.</p>
<p>Actually calculating the baseline is done with the commands in the <b>Baseline Calculate</b> pane. Two different
methods are possible. The first uses the selected points in the spectrum to fit to up to a ten-term polynomial.
The other method uses a moving average to calculate the baseline. First, select the method you want with the
check boxes, then you can press the <b>Calculate Baseline</b> button to see what the calculated baseline
looks like. For either method, you may decide you want to include or remove additional points in the spectrum.
Go ahead and do this and then press the <b>Calculate Baseline</b> button again. Each method has a single
adjustable parameter. For the Polynomial method, you can select the number of polynomial terms with the
<b>Order</b> drop-down selection. Selecting a polynomial of less than ten terms is very useful when most
of your spectrum is occupied by NMR line intensity and only a small portion is assignable to baseline.</p>
<p>The Moving Average method will replace each point in that is assigned to be in the baseline by the
<b>Width</b> number of points around the point. &quot;32&quot; is a good number for typical high-resolution
spectra of at least 16k points in size. A value of less than this may be better for smaller data files.</p>
<p>Once you are happy with the calculated baseline, press the <b>Apply Baseline</b> button to subtract
the calculated baseline from the spectrum.</p>
<p>The <b>Process Shelf</b> can be use to store and retrieve a baseline region quickly on the
<a href="ribbon_tab_shelf.htm">Processing Shelf</a>. Unless you already have something on the shelf,
it is always a good idea to save you current baseline selection to the shelf, in case you want to 
completely reprocess the spectrum. The <b>To Shelf</b> button will only be active when you have defined
at least one baseline region to exclude from the baseline. The <b>From Shelf</b> button will only
be active when there are baseline regions on the shelf.</p>
