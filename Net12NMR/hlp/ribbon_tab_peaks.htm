<title>Ribbon Peak-Picking Tab</title>
</head>
<body>
<p><i>Net12NMR</i> defines peaks as points in a spectrum that is in between two adjacent points of lesser intensity. A peak may have
a flat top (two or more points with the exact same intensity). This algorithm is not designed for broad, low S/N peaks. In that
case, you can accurately determine the peak chemical shift by using <i>NetSpan</i> to deconvolute the peak parameters. With limited
space across the top of the display, all peaks may not be labeled if they are too close together. In that case, you can zoom in for
a closer look or look to the &quot;Peaks&quot; tab of the <a href="output_window.htm">Output Window</a>. All found peaks will be
listed there.</p>
<p>The peak-picking Ribbon tab, labeled <b>Peaks</b> contains three panes: <b>Action</b>, <b>Listing</b> and <b>Process Shelf</b>.</p>
<p>The <b>Actions</b> pane has a command button for deleting all currently defined peak thresholds, <b>Clear All Thresholds</b>. It also
has a button for clearing any thresholds between the zoom cursors, <b>Clear Single Region</b>. The <b>Spreadsheet Analysis</b> button
will produce a spreadsheet that has an interaction matrix that shows the Hz and PPM differences for all the peaks found in the current
displayed region of the active document.</p>
<p>Please note that there is no command button for setting a threshold and this is because these must be set using the graphical user
interface: Place the zoom cursors around desired new threshold region the place the the cross-hairs cursor at the height of the desired
threshold, context mouse click and select <b>Set Threshold</b>.</p>
<p>A shortcut also exists for setting and clearing thresholds: While setting the zoom cursors, hold down the Shift-key or the Control-key
to set or clear a threshold between the zoom cursors. Using this method to set a threshold the intensity value of the resulting
threshold will be at the height of the cross-hairs cursor when you start setting the zoom cursors (when you click the mouse select
button).</p>
<p>Control item in the <b>Listing</b> pane determine the form of the peak listings. When checked, the <b>Use parabolic fit</b> will list
found peaks using the maxium of a parabola to fit the top few points in the found peak. otherwise the peak positions are
simply the chemical shift of the maximum point found. Listing can be in Hertz or PPM selected by the checkboxes in this pane. The
number of places to the right of the decimal point can set for both PPM and Hertz listing through two drop-down selectors in this pane.</p>
<p>Peak region can be pulled from or stored to the <a href="ribbon_tab_shelf.htm">Processing Shelf</a> in the <b>Process Shelf</b>
pane. On the Processing Shelf, peak heights are stored as fractions of the spectrum range so that different spectra (of similar compounds)
can still benefit from these thresholds.</p>
<p>Selecting the <b>Peaks</b> tab will also automatically show the &quot;Peaks&quot; tab of the <a href="output_window.htm">Output Window</a>.</p>
