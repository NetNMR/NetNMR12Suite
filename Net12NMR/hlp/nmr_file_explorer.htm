<title>NMR File Explorer</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The <b>NMR File Explorer</b> is used to open and import NMR files into <i>Net12NMR</i>. The tree-like structure
is divided into two main branches, local disk drives, <b>Drives</b> and NMR file servers, <b>Servers</b>. Local disk
drives include all local drive systems as well as Windows&trade; shared drives. NMR file servers are defined in the
Registry during the software installation process. When first started <i>Net12NMR</i> displays all accessible
drive systems.</p>
<p>Single-click on a branch to open it. This will automatically close an open branch that is not below the
branch selected. For example, clicking on <b>Servers</b> will close all <b>Drives</b> and display all available
NMR file servers.</p>
<p>Single-click on a drive or server and contents the base directory for that item will be shown. The contents
shown will include any subdirectories as well as any suitable NMR data files. As much as possible, an icon will
be associated with each item that helps identify what that item is. Files that are not recongnized as folders or
NMR files will not be displayed. You can open a subdirectory by a single mouse click. NMR files can be opened
with a double-click. NMR files can also be opened by a single context (usually left mouse button) click and then
select-clicking on the &quot;Open&quot; context menu item. You can alternatively select the &quot;Properties&quot;
context menu item for a short description of the NMR file type.
