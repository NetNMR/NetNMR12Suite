<P><A NAME="hid_process_ilt"></A><B>ILT command (Process menu)</B></P>
<P>This command shows a dialog used to fit the observed data with a sum of exponential kernel functions.The coefficients of these exponentials are constrained to be greater than zero.The kernel function is selected with the <a href="hid_process_kerneltype.htm">Process Kernel</a> menucommand. The user can select one of three different fitting methods to fit positive sums of the kernelfunction to the observed data. In all cases, ILT includes a constant term (a term that has no <b>X-value</b>dependence. This <b>constant</b> term is extremely important for the fitting process and accounts for non-zerospectrometer baseline levels as might be based in spectrometer electronics or data processing techniques.This <b>constant</b> term can take on any real value, positive or negative.</p><p>The three fitting algorithms used by ILT are:</p><p><b>1. Wiscombe-Evans-Gragg-LeVeque</b>, (WEGL), is an iterative technique first described by Wiscombe and Evansin &quot;Exponential-Sum Fitting of Radiative Transmission Functions&quot; <i>J. Comput. Phys. <b>24</b></i>,416(1977) and then improved on in &quot;On Least Squares Exponential Sum Approximation with PositiveCoefficients&quot; by Evans, Gragg and LeVeque in <i>Math. of Compu. <b>24</b></i>, 203(1980). This methoditeratively selects a &quot;best&quot; new kernel term to add to the current simulation to improve the fit. Ifno new term is found the iteration is complete. If a new term is found, the coefficients of all the terms arerecalculated. This may result in some terms taking on negative coefficients. If so, these terms are dropped, oneat a time until all the remaining terms have positive coefficients. ILT uses a specially modified NNLS asdescribed above to eliminate current terms with negative coefficients.</p><p><b>2. Inverse Laplace Transform</b> is based on a non-negative least squares (NNLS) method first describedby Lawson and Hanson in &quot;Solving Least Square Problems&quot;, published by Prentice-Hall in 1974. Themethod of Lawson and Hanson has been specially modified by ILT to include a final constant term than canhave any real-valued coefficient. Appling NNLS to the ILT kernel functions, an array of kernel functionsare used. The range of relaxation values for the array of kernel functions are specified in the<b>From:</b> and <b>To:</b> edit boxes. These numbers must be positive and the <b>From:</b> value mustbe less than the <b>To:</b> value. The relaxation value (either a rate or a time constant, see the<a href="hid_process_kerneltype.htm">Process Kernel</a> menu command) will be logarithmically spaced over thisrange. The <b>Count:</b> edit boxes will specify the number of relaxation values. Unlike some fittingtechniques, it is entirely acceptable to have more relaxation values to fit than the number of observations.The default value of 0.1 to 100 may not be appropriate in all cases. It is highly advisable to adjust theseparameters in the event of a poorer than expected fit.</p><p>For the <b>InverseLaplace Transform</b>, a positve <b>alpha</b> value can be specified. When <b>alpha</b> is greater than zero,this will have an effect of &quot;broadening&quot; the distribution of relaxation values used to fit theobserved data. The higher the <b>alpha</b> value, the more broadening will be applied. In practice, it isusually best to first examine the <b>alpha</b>=0 case first to see how many terms are needed to fit thedata without any broadening. The user should note the residual sum of squares or the standard error. Then theuser can recalculate the <b>Inverse Laplace Transform</b> with <b>alpha</b>&gt;0 and then adjust <b>alpha</b>accordingly to get the desired broadening. In all cases, fits with <b>alpha</b>&gt;0 gives larger residualsum of squares and standard error that when <b>alpha</b> is zero.</p><p><b>3. SIRT, for simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique,</b> is a technique designed to producethe broadest possible density function and is described in &quot;A New Method for Multi-Exponential Inversion
of NMR Relaxation Measurements&quot; by Zhongdong Wang, Lizhi Xiao and Tangyan Liu in <i>Science in ChinaSeries G Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy 47</i>, 265(2004). Two parameters are required for SIRT, an iterationcounter and a tolerance. Both parameter are used to stop the SIRT iteration. SIRT asymptotically approachesits minimum so many iteration are required. This is a lenghty process so 100,000 iterations is the defaultvalue for the iteration counter. Sometimes more is required. The tolerance is the amount the sum-of-squaresof the iterative correction has shrunk at the current iteration. 1.0e-7 is the default. Because SIRT onlyproduces broad density functions, post-fitting processes are not allowed.</p><p>With either WEGL or ILT, fitting algorithm, two &quot;post-fitting&quot; processes can be applied to theresulting data fit:</p><p><b>1. Simplify</b> will coalesce adjacent terms. That is, terms with similar relaxation values will becombined. Note that if the <b>Simplify</b> check box is selected the <b>alpha</b> value will be automaticallyset to zero. Both the Inverse Laplace Transform and the WEGL method tend to produce terms that are veryclose to one-another. <b>Simplify</b> will replace similar terms with a single term. The amplitude of the newterm will be the sum of the amplitudes of the terms it is replacing. The relaxation value of the new termwill be the weighted average of the relaxation value of the terms it is replacing.</p><p><b>2. Optimize</b> is a process that can only be applied after simplification. Optimization uses a downhillsimplex minimize the fitting error by adjusting both the amplitude and the relaxation value of each term.Downhill simplex is an iterative process and is terminated if the successive residual sum of squares is nolonger improved, or if the normal of the calculated parameter changes is below some small value, or if thenumber of simplex iterations exceeds some large value.</p><p>If the <b>Simplify</b> box is checked, the resulting view of the fit terms will indicate the uncertaintyin each intensity and relaxation value of each term by <a href="menu_confidence.htm">encircling the termin an ellipse</a> whose dimensions are the standard error of the intensity and relaxation value.</p><p>If the <b>Optimize</b> box is checked, the confidence of the fit is specified with the Confidence Intervalradio buttons. Specifying high confidence levels will generally result in a model with fewer terms becausehigher confidence intervals result in wider confidence limits, so terms that marginally reject the nullhypothesis (H0: intensity is not equal to zero) at low confidence will not be able to reject the nullhypothesis at high confidence levels. Occasionally, specifing higher confidence levels can sucessfully producea model where lower confidence levels will produce no terms.</p><p>If the input data is made up of multiple decays (or multiple recoveries), an additional check box canbe used to indicate if the user-selected fitting will be done on the current decay or all thedecays of the dataset.</p></BODY>
