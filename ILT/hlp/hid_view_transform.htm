<P><A NAME="hid_view_transform"></A><B>Transform command (View menu)</B></P><p>The <b>Transform</b> command is a toggle to select two different views of the input data.</p>

<p>The first
view is <b>X</b> <i>vs.</i> <b>Y</b> of the input data. The <b>X</b>-value is always displayed with a
logrithmic axis. The scales are automatically adjusted so that all input data is displayed. If a fit
has been calcuated, the fitting function is displayed along with the differences. Differences use an
independent secondary axis plotted on the right side of the plotting area.</p>

<p>The second view is the fitting density function. In this plot, each term in the fit is plotted
separately. As above, the horizontal axis is logrithmic. Each term is a line and represents the
fitting function as represented as a transform. If the fit has been simplified (see the
<a href="hid_process_ilt.htm">ILT process</a> menu command), an error ellipse for
each term will also be plotted in this view. This represents the standard error of the intensity
and relaxation parameter of each term. This ellipses can have a distinct non-ellipitical shape because
of the logrithmic scale of the horizontal axis.</p>
