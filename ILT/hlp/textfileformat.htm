<p>*.TXT files are currently the only way to initially input data to <b>ILT</b>.The text file is made up of an X-value and multiple observe vectors in columnsseparated by tabs and/or spaces. Comment lines can beincluded in the file only if the first, non-whitespace character is a&quot;<b>#</b>&quot;.</p><p>The first non-comment line of the file should contain column headings. Each colum heading has to beseparated by tabs. Individual column headings can contain spaces. In the case of a relaxation dataset,the X-value heading should be the time units. The first column of data in subsequent lines of theinput file are the X-values of all of the other columns of observations (Y-values).Column headings for the exponential observation(s) shouldbe the name for that exponential, usually a chemical shift or chemical shift range, but it can alsobe a sample name.</p><p>In the case of a DOSY data set, the column heading for the X-value can be anything as this stringwill not be used by ILT. The actual X-value vector (the first item in subsequent lines of the inputfile) should be the DAC value for that row of data. Three values are needed by ILT to convert thisDAC value to the proper units so that Diffusion Constants can be calculated. Then, two additionalvalues are needed to convert the Diffusion Constants to Hydrodynamic Radii:</p><p><b>Dosygamma</b> or <b>gamma</b> is the nuclear magnetogyric ratio of the evolving spins during the DOSY delay. Theunits are inverse(Tesla-seconds).</p><p><b>Timecubed</b> or <b>tcubed</b> is equal to &quot;square(gt) * (delay - gt/3)&quot; where gt is the gradient time.The units are cubed(seconds)</p><p><b>DACtoG</b> is the gradient strength in gauss/cm/DAC_unit.</p><p><b>Temperature</b> or <b>temp</b> is the sample temperature.</p><p><b>Viscosity</b> or <b>visc</b> is the solvent viscosity.</p><p>The solvent can also be specified with <b>solvent</b> but must be exactly <i>without case sensitivity</i> matchan existing solvent.</p><p>These DOSY constants can be input through a comment line, like:</p><code># DACtoG = 0.00233</code><p>If these values are not specified in the comments, ILT will supply default values (which areprobably wrong) when the <a href="hid_process_kerneltype.htm">Kernel dialog</a> is displayed andthe user selects the DOSY kernel. These value names are not case sensitive.</p><p>If all you have are spectra, <b>NetSpan</b>, <b>NetPlot</b> and a spreadsheet program are usefulprograms for getting started in creating an ILT input text file. Also, sample input text files are includedwith the installation of <b>ILT</b> and are located in the same directory with ILT.exe.</p></BODY>
