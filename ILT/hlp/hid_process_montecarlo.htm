<p>This command will display a dialog used to perform a Monte Carlo simulation. This commandcommand can be performed anytime <i>and</i>destroy the current document.</p><p>A Monte Carlo simulation is performed by adding noise to an ideal &quot;observed&quot; data set.This ideal dataset is calculated from a set of exponential terms. In aniterative fashion, each data point of this base dataset is summed with noise from a randomnoise generator that produces noise with a mean of zero and a specific standard deviation.On each iteration, the base dataset plus a new set of noise is fit by ILT according to theuser specified optimization. The exponential terms from this fit are then retained in a listand the iteration continues with a newly generated decay.</p><p>The Monte Carlo simulation dialog contains a list box that is used to specify all of theexponential terms in the model decay. Each term is represented as an intensity and either adiffusion rate or a relaxation time. Buttons and two edit boxes exist to add additional termsto the current fit or delete selected terms. Multiple terms can be added from the clipboard withthe &quot;Paste&quot; button. The first two fields of each line of text on the clipboard willbecome the amplitude and rate or time of a new term. If two fields specifying numbers greater thanzero are not found, that line is ignored. If all terms are deleted, a Monte Carlo simulationcannot be started.</p><p>Before starting the Monte Carlo simulation, the user should specify two parameters:</p><p>The <b>Standard Error:</b> parameter specifies the RMS value of the noise to be added to eachdata point in the ideal base dataset (generated by the terms in the list box).</p><p>The <b>Iterations:</b> parameter specifies how many iterations will be done in the Monte Carlosimulation. Be aware that a large number here could potentially take a long time to calculate.If a single optimized fit of the originaldata takes 10 seconds, A Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 iterations will take over three hoursto complete. 10,000 iterations will take over a day.</p><p>After selecting the <b>Okay</b> button, the simulation will begin. Once completed, the<a href="hid_view_transform.htm">Transform view</a> will display all the survivingterms that were generated in the simulation in a x-y dot plot. Terms that end up outside theFrom-To range specified in the <a href="hid_process_ilt.htm">ILT Dialog</a> will be discarded duringthe optimization process. This Monte Carlo-only discard mechanism will occur at the end of theoptimization, and if performed will trigger another simplex optimization loop.The <a href="hid_view_text.htm">Text view</a> will tell how Monte Carlo trials returned one,two, three, <i>etc</i> terms, not including the constant term. The listed report of 10-termMonte Carlo trails might be underestimated because all trials with more than 10 terms arealso represented here. In any event, the text will list the total number terms in the plot.many terms are plotted.</p><p>The color of the plotted term points can be adjusted according number of each terms in aMonte Carlo iteration. The colors are selected in the <a href="afx_hidd_color.htm">Color Dialog</a>.</p></BODY>
