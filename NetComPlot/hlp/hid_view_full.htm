<p>This command will set the horizontal and vertical range scales
to PPM and will adjust the 2D window to display every point of
every 2D spectrum in the current document. That is to say that a new
display region will be chosen that will contain exactly all of the
2D file in the current document. 1D dataset ranges are not considered.</p>
