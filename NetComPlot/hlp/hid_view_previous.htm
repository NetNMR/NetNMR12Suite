<p>This command will set the horizontal and vertical range scales
to the previous display region. This command is based on a push-down
list. When the user changes the display region
using the zoom box, returning to the full width,
or defining a new display region with the <a href="hid_edit_parameters.htm">
Edit Parameters Dialog</a>, the previous region will be placed on the
push-down list. This command pops the most recent region on the push-down
list and returns the display to this region.</p>

<p>Besides regions, the push-down list also contains other display parameters,
including the plot width and height, plot offsets and axis and page colors.</p>
