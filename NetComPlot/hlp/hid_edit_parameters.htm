<P>The Parameters command displays a dialog used to adjust
everything about the current NetComPlot composite plot (except NMR
file selection).
</P>

<P>In the upper left corner of this dialog, the range of data to
be displayed is specified. Specify the vertical and horizontal
range in PPM or Hertz. You must specify the plot range in PPM or
Hertz. All files will be plotted correctly according to
the range specified.  Please Note that this means that only a
piece of the spectrum (or nothing at all) might be plotted, if the
specified PPM or Hertz range is not common to the spectrum. A
"Full" button is available for setting either the horizontal or
vertical range according to all the 2D data in the current
document. 
</P>

<P>In the upper right of the dialog the size of each
region is specified. All sizes and 1D offsets are in centimeters.
The first horizontal and vertical 1-D spectra are
plotted next to the 2-D axis tic marks. Each additional 1-D
spectrum is offset by the specified amount. 
The 2-D offset is is computed from the approimate computed size of
the graphics.
</P>

<P>The background color of the page and the color of the axis 
as well as the color of the file information can
be selected in the Colors group box.
</P>

<P>Near the center of the page, the contour plotting parameters of
each of the 2-D spectra is specified. Select the 2-D file from the
drop-down list box and each plotting parameter can be adjusted.
Mode selects positive, negative or both contours. Contours is the
number of contours to be plotted.  Spacing is either Linear
spacing or Logarithmic contour spacing.  %Ceiling and %Floor
specify where the height of where the contours are placed and are
a percentage of the largest magnitude in the 2-D data set.
Finally the colors of the positive and negative contours can be
selected.
</P>

<P>Near the bottom of the dialog, the 1-D spectra parameters are
specified.  Select the particular horizontal or vertical spectrum
in the drop-down list box. %Floor and %Ceiling is the range of
intensities the 1-D spectra will be scaled compared to the largest
(100%) and smallest (0%) intensities in the 1-D file(s).
