<P>Use this command to display a dialog to manage the 1- and
2-dimension data in the current composite plot. On the left o
 this dialog, you can connect to different NetNMR servers and
 add new 1- and 2-D data.  Click on any server in the NMR Server
 list and the list box below will be filled with the names of
 directories and processed NMR data files on the current directory
 from that server.
</P>
<P>Double clicking on a directory will move to that directory.
Double clicking on an NMR file will add that file to the
NetComPlot composite file. If the NMR file is a 2-D file, it will
be added to the 2-D list. If the file is a 1-D NMR file you will
be asked if you want that file added to the list of horizontal NMR
files or vertical NMR files.  Horizontal files will appear above
the 2-D spectra and vertical files will appear to the left of the
2-D spectra.
</P>
<P>Since NetComPlot does not allow the user to rotate the 2-D
spectra, the horizontal/vertical decision is an important,
especially for heteronuclear 2-D composite plots. However if a
mistake is made about the placement of a 1-D spectrum, it is
easy to move the 1-D spectra back and forth between horizontal
and vertical by first selecting the 1-D spectrum in this dialog
and then hitting the active arrow button between the horizontal
and vertical 1-D list boxes.
</P>
<P>The order in which 2-D, horizontal 1-D and vertical 1-D files
appear in these three lists boxes is important. 2-D spectra are
rendered in reverse order. That is, 2-D spectra that appear higher
in the list will appear to be draw above, or on top of 2-D spectra
lower in the list.  1-D spectra higher in the vertical or
horizontal list boxes will be rendered farther away from the 2-D
spectra. The order of any of the spectra in any of the 3 list
boxes can be easily changed: First select the spectrum to be moved
and simply press the Move Up or Move Down button.
</P>
<P>Any file can be removed from the NetComPlot by selecting the
file and pressing the Remove button. All NMR spectra can be
removed by pressing the Remove All button.
</P>
<P>NetComPlot retains a small amount of text-based information
about each NMR file in the composite file. This information can be
modified to include any text-based information you like by
pressing the Edit Info… button.  The first line of this text will
be used as the NMR spectrum label in the Parameters dialog and
when you revisit this dialog. You may not edit this information
until the file has been displayed at least once.
</P>
<P>Finally, projections from any 2D data can be calculated and
added to the list of 1D spectra to be plotted. Simply select the
2D data you wish to project and press the “Projection” button.
(The button will not be active until the 2D spectrum has been
displayed at least once. A dialog will be displayed so the user
can choose from four different projections, two for the directly
detected dimension and two for the indirectly detected dimension.
For each dimension, the user can choose a positive projection or a
negative projection that shows respectively the maximum or minimum
data point along that row or column. A simple graph is used so the
user can easily select which projections are desired. On selecting
“OK” projections are calculated and added to the appropriate 1D
list. At that point they are like any other 1D spectrum that has
been added. They may be moved or deleted.
