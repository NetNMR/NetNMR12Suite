<p>The offset of any spectrum in the NetComPlot composite plot
can be adjusted by first moving the cursor to an position on any
spectrum and then selecting this command from the Context menu.
You will then be prompted for the new offset value. If the cursor
is over a 2D spectrum, you will be prompted for both the
horizontal and vertical offset. You can change one or the other or
both. If more than one 2-D spectrum is in the current composite,
you can only change the offset of the top spectrum.  If you need
to change the offset of a spectrum that is not on top, move it
to the top with the <a href="hid_file_data.htm">NMR Data
Dialog</a> and then move it back to its
original position when you have changed the offset.</p>
