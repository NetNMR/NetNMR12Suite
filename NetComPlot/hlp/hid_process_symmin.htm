<BODY>
<p>
This menu command is used to symmetrize homonuclear 2D data. The
homonuclear dataset to be symmetrized must have the same number of
points, sweep width and offset. Only then is this command
active.
</P>
<p>
Points across the diagonal are replaced with the minimum of the
two symmetry related points. If one point is negative and one is
positive amplitude, both are set to zero.
