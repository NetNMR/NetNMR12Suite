<p>This command is only active if neither of the 2-D dimensions is in
Full mode and a zoom box is displayed. Selecting this command will
bring up a dialog displaying information about the integral. The
dimensions of the zoom box (in PPM) is displayed along with the
integral value. Also, the number of 2D points summed for the
integral value is displayed. If more than one 2D spectra is being
displayed, the number of points appear in parentheses after the
file name. (The filename used is the first line of the file info
and so can be edited in the <a href="hid_file_data.htm">File Data
Dialog</a> to have any value you want.)</p>
