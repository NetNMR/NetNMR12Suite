<P><A NAME="hid_process_process"></A><B>Process Dialog</B></P>



<P>The <b>Process Dialog</b> is used to convert raw free induction data (FID) to
Fourier transformed spectra. The button commands on this dialog only work on
data that has been <a href="hid_file_add.htm">added</a> during the current session
and only if the raw FID files have been imported. Any button command performed on
data that has already been transformed will be ignored and no error will be reported
to the user. Please note that raw FID data will not be saved in a Netplot (*.npl) file,
so raw FID data must be Fourier transformed during the same session that the file
data was <a href="hid_file_add.htm">added</a>. Each of the buttons iterate over all
spectra in the current document. This dialog contains the following buttons:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=900>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>DC Level button</TD>

<TD width=82%>This command averages the last 1/16 of the real and imaginary FID data and
subtracts that average from the real and imaginary data.</TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>Truncate button</TD>

<TD width=82%>This command reduces the current data size until the next power of 2.</TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>Apodize button</TD>

<TD width=82%>This command performs apodization on each FID. Lorentian or Gaussian can be chosen
with a user-selectable dropdown while the amount of broadening can be selected in another dropdown
This dropdown will also accept any numeric value the user types. The units of the numeric value (<b>PPM</b>
or <b>Hertz</b>) are selectable through a third dropdown.</TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>Zerofill</TD>

<TD width=82%>Each FID is zerofilled up to the next power of 2.</TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>FT</TD>

<TD width=82%>Each FID is Fourier transformed. If the current data size is not a power
of 2, it is zerofilled first. The current global phase correction is applied to the
new spectrum.</TD>
