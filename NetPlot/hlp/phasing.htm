<TITLE>How to manually phase an entire NetPlot document</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<p>While phasing command buttons on the <a href="hid_process_phase.htm">phase dialog</a> can be
performed on all spectra in the current NetPlot document, this is not desirable in some cases.
Often, various kinds of relaxation experiments will display a small phase shift from spectrum
to spectrum and autophase my not produce an acceptible phase for each spectrum. In that case
the <b>At Cursor</b> button command is the preferred technique for phasing.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to perform inital automatic phase corrections on each of the spectra,
because the <b>At Cursor</b> phase mode will automatically update each spectrum with the current
global phase when moving between the different spectra.</p>

<p>Start manually phasing by first selecting either the top-most or bottom-most spectrum in the
<b>Applys to:</b> selection drop-down list. (The <b>All</b> checkbox must cleared before an
individual spectrum can be selected. Before pressing the <b>At Cursor</b> button, the zoom cursors
should be placed on resonances near the left and right side of the current displayed region. (If the
<b>At Cursor</b> button is pressed before the zoom cursors are set, NetPlot will remind you to
set the zoom cursors.)</p>

<p>After pressing the <b>At Cursor</b> button, the selected spectrum will be displayed in the middle
of the display window, without the boundry sheet. The mouse cursor will disappear and vertical mouse
motion will move the phase of the spectrum around the left or right cursor. (the current location of the
control point will be display by a single zoom cursor.) As the mouse is moved up and down the phase
of the entire spectrum will be adjusted while holding the non-selected zoom cursor point at zero.
You can select between the left and right zoom cursors by either typing <b>L</b> or <b>R</b> on the
keyboard or pressing the left mouse button.</p>

<p>It is generally useful to highly expand the vertical scale of the spectrum so that the phasing
around the base of the peaks can be seen in detail. The vertical expansion can be adjusted <b>up</b>
or <b>down</b> with the <b>U</b> or <b>D</b> keys, respectively. Iterating between the left and right
zoom cursors a couple of times is usualy sufficient to produce a satisfactory phase correction.</p>

<p>While you can apply this current phase correction to all other spectra in the current document
by typing a <b>C</b> to exit the manual phase mode and then pressing one of the buttons in the
<b>Clone Phase:</b> section, you can switch to the next spectrum without leaving the manual
phase mode. The <b>Q</b> and <b>Z</b> keys move to the spectrum above or below the currently selected
spectrum. Moving between spectra in this way perserves the current Y-scale and immediately applies
the current global phase to the new spectrum. In this way you can quickly phase an entire NetPlot
document. If you find that spectra are immediately acceptable without further mouse adjustment
<b><i>and</i></b> it is susupected that all of the remaining spectra will not need any special
adjustment, you can exit the manually phasing mode by typing <b>C</b> and then using one of the
<b>Clone Phase:</b> buttons to propagate the current global phase to the remaining spectra.</p>

<p>If you want to move to a spectrum that is not adjcent to the current spectrum and <b>don't</b>
want to affect the phase of the spectra between, exit the manual phasing mode by typing <b>C</b>
and then selecting the desired spectrum in the <b>Apply To:</b> drop-down selection list
and finally pressing the <b>At Cursor</b> button.</p>

<p>When in the <b>At Cursor</b> manual phase mode, there are several special keyboard commands
available:</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td><b>L</b></td>
<td>Move to the <b>l</b>eft cursor.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>R</b></td>
<td>Move to the <b>r</b>ight cursor.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>C</b></td>
<td>Exit (<b>c</b>omplete) the manual phasing mode.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>T</b></td>
<td>Rese<b>t</b> the phase to the last global phase point. (The last global phase point is saved when
moving between spectra with the <b>Q</b> or <b>Z</b> keys.)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>U</b></td>
<td>Blow <b>u</b>p the vertical expansion.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>D</b></td>
<td>Shrink <b>d</b>own the vertical expansion.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Q</b></td>
<td>Move to the spectrum above. If you are already at the top of the NetPlot document, this
command will do nothing.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Z</b></td>
<td>Move to the spectrum below. If you are already at the bottomof the NetPlot document, this
command will do nothing.</td>
</tr>
