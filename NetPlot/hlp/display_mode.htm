<TITLE>NetPlot Display Mode</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<p>The <i>NetPlot</i> display mode is set primarily with the
<a href="hid_edit_parameters.htm">Parameters</a> dialog. There are three display modes:</p>

<table>

<tr>
<td><b>None</b></td>
<td>No axis is drawn in this mode. Each spectrum is exactly the same width on the plot
and there is no offset according to the offset of each individual spectrum.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>PPM</b></td>
<td>Includes an axis in PPM. Each spectrum is drawn in relaxation to the axis.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Hertz</b></td>
<td>Includes an axis in Hertz. Each spectrum is drawn in relation to the axis.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>Once the display mode is set to either <b>PPM</b> or <b>Hertz</b>, a main cursor will
track the mouse arrow. The main cursor is a vertical line drawn over all the spectra in
the current document. The chemical shift of the main cursor position is listed in the
status panel at the bottom of the window. In addition, the <a href="zoom_cursors.htm">zoom
cursors</a> can then be set by click-drag-release action with the left mouse button.</p>

<p>If all the spectra in the current document have identical sweep widths, spectrometer
frequencies, offsets and number of points, regions can be selected and baselines corrected and
integrals calculated over any number
of regions with the <a href="hid_process_regions.htm">Regions dialog</a>, but only if the display
mode is <b><i>not</i></b> set to <b>None</b>.</p>

<p>If the <a href="hid_view_full.htm">Full</a> menu command (available in both the
<a href="menu_view.htm">View Menu</a> and the <a href="menu_context.htm">Context Menu</a>)
is executed in the <b>None</b> display mode, it will be changed to <b>PPM</b> automatically.</p>

<p>There are special display modes associated with phasing and baseline correction. When using
the <a href="hid_process_phase.htm">At Cursor</a> phasing command, the display only shows a single
spectrum from the NetPlot document while the user adjusts the phase. In this mode, the cursor is
hidden from the user and a special context menu is available for manual phase. For more information,
see the How To... <a href="phasing.htm">manually phase an entire document</a>.</p>

<p>After pressing the <b>Baseline:</b> <a href="hid_process_regions.htm">Calculate button</a>, the
NetPlot will display calculated polynomial baseline corrections along with the spectra in the current
NetPlot document.</p>

<p>Another special display mode is when ajusting indivial spectrum Y-scale factors with the
<a href="hid_process_yexpansion.htm">Y-Expansion dialog</a>. Anytime this dialog is displayed the
<b>UP-Arrow</b>, <b>DOWN-Arrow</b> and the mouse wheel control the individual, selected spectrum
Y-scale. Whenever this dialog is not display, these controls adjust the Y-scale of all the spectra.</p>
