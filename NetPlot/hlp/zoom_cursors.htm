<p>Zoom cursors are only available if the spectum X-Offset is exactly zero. In addtion, zoom cursors
only be set if the display mode is not "Full", or if each of the displayed spectra have
identical size, offset, spectrometer frequency and sweep widths (<i>i.e.</i>, the exact same window).
The range mode and X-Offset are set in the <a href="hid_edit_parameters.htm">Parameters Dialog</a>.
</p>
<p>Zoom cursors are set by an integrated mouse movement. Clicking the left mouse button down will set
one of the zoom cursors at the current position of the cursors. While holding down the mouse button,
move the cursor to the location of where the other zoom cursor position is needed. Letting up on the
left mouse button will set this position. Zoom cursors can be set sweeping the mouse left-to-right or
right to left. It doesn't matter.</p>
