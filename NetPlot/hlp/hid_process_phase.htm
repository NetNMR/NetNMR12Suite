<P><A NAME="hid_process_phase"></A><B>Phase Dialog</B></P>



<P>The <b>Phase Dialog</b> is used to phase recently
Fourier transformed spectra. The button commands on this dialog only work on
data that have been <a href="hid_file_add.htm">added</a> during the current session
and only if the raw FID files have been imported and then transformed using the
<a href="hid_process_process.htm">Process dialog</a>. Please note that imaginary
data will not be saved in a Netplot (*.npl) file,
so data must be phased during the same session that the file
data was <a href="hid_file_add.htm">added</a>. Use the "Applies to" feature to direct
the current command to either an individual spectrum, or all the spectra in the current
NetPlot document. After phasing, any baseline correction previously done on the spectrum
will be lost. This dialog contains the following buttons:</P>

<TABLE cols=2 width=900>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>All checkbox</TD>

<TD width=82%>This checkbox determine the object of each of the phase commands. Checking
this box will apply the desired phase correction on all of the data in the current document.
Unchecking this box will activate the ajacent dropdown and a single spectrum in the current
NetPlot document can be selected.</TD>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>All Others button</TD>

<TD width=82%>This command is only available if the <b>All checkbox</b> is currently
not selected. This command will propagate the current global phase correction to all spectra
in the current NetPlot document except the spectrum currently selected in the <b>Apply to:</b>
dropdown.</TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>Up button</TD>

<TD width=82%>This command is only available if the <b>All checkbox</b> is currently
not selected. This command will propagate the current global phase correction to all spectra
<b>above</b> the spectrum currently selected in the <b>Apply to:</b>
dropdown.</TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>Down button</TD>

<TD width=82%>This command is only available if the <b>All checkbox</b> is currently
not selected. This command will propagate the current global phase correction to all spectra
<b>below</b> the spectrum currently selected in the <b>Apply to:</b>
dropdown.</TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>Auto A Only button</TD>

<TD width=82%>The linear global phase correction is set to zero and the global phase constant
is varied for the spectrum to automatically optimze the phase. The spectrum range of this command
is determined by the controls in the <b>Apply to:</b> selection box.</TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>Auto A & B button</TD>

<TD width=82%>Both the linear global phase correction and the global phase constant
is varied for the spectrum to automatically optimze the phase. The spectrum range of this command
is determined by the controls in the <b>Apply to:</b> selection box.</TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>Magnitude button</TD>

<TD width=82%>The phase-independent magnitude spectrum is calculated.</TD>

</TR>

<TR VALIGN="top">

<TD width=18%>At Cursor button</TD>

<TD width=82%>This command is only enabled when the <b>All</b> checkbox is unselected.
When this button is pressed, the NetPlot display only displays the selected spectrum,
allowing the user to mouse-adjust the phase at the position of the two zoom cursors.
Keyboard commands <b>L</b> and <b>R</b> will move between the left and right zoom cursors,
respectively. (Alternately, the left mouse button can be used to toggle between the left
and right cursor phase modes.) the phase of the spectrum of the other cursor will be held in place
while the user move the mouse up and down. (Right and left mouse motion will be ignored.)
The <b>Shift</b> and <b>Control</b> keys can be used to respectively amplify and soften
the effect of the mouse movements on the computed phase correction.
When the user is satisfied with the current phase correction, a <b>C</b> key press will terminate the
<b>At Cursor</b> phase mode. While in this interactive phasing mode, the vertical expansion
of the spectrum can be adjusted up or down with the <b>U</b> and <b>D</b> keys. The current phase can
be reset with a <b>T</b> key press. Alternatively, you can immediately move to the next spectrum (above or below)
by pressing the <b>Q</b> or <b>Z</b> keys. In this case the phase at the current spectrum will then
define the global phase spectrum and this will be applied to the next spectrum. The current expansion
and zoom regions as well as the location of the zoom cursors will be maintained, making it easy to phase
an entire NetPlot Document. The <b>L</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>U</b>, <b>D</b>, <b>T</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>Q</b>
and <b>Z</b>
keyboard command are also available from a context menu by clicking the right mouse button
while in the <b>At Cursor</b> phase mode.</TD>
