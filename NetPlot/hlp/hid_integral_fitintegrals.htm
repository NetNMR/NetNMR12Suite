<p>Fit Integrals Command (Integral Menu)</p>

<p>If there are integrals in the current display, they will be calculated for each spectrum in
the current NetPlot document. These integral values will then be transferred to a new spreadsheet
workbook. A
spreadsheet macro (that is in another hidden workbook)
will allow the integral data for each spectrum to be fit to a user selected function (model). The
integrals from each region defined with the <a href="hid_integral_addintegral.htm">Add Integral</a>
Command become the y-values. The x-values are take from the <a href="hid_edit_labels.htm">
spectrum labels</a>. In the case of a relaxation experiment, the <a href="hid_edit_parameters.htm">
Parameter Dialog</a> can be used to specify the specta labels from a
header variable name that contains the correct
relaxation parameter. (Sometimes the relaxation value is "d2" on Varian systems or "vd" on Bruker
system.)</p>

<p>The speadsheet macro in the hidden workbook
will automatically build a new menu item called "NMR". In the NMR menu is a "Fit Integrals"
command that will build a spreadsheet around the pasted integral data that came from NetPlot.
This will construct a new worksheet that will use one of several
different user-selected modelling functions to fit the x <i>vs.</i> y data. Each integral in the
current display will have a separate, parameterized model constructed. The "Solver" speadsheet
command can then be used to minumize the error between the observed integral data and the selected
model by varying the model parameters. In addtion to a standard error calculation for each integral
region as well as the total standard error for all regions. Standard errors for each parameter are
also calculated and displayed in the workbook.</p>

<p>The hidden workbook doing all the work is the same one used to fit calculated integrals
in NetSpan.</p>

<p>This command will only be active if there are defined integral regions in the current display.</p>
