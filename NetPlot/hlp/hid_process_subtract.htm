<P>The <b>Subtract Dialog</b> is used to subtract a selected spectrum or spectra from
all the spectra in the current document. This process will only work of all of the
spectra in the current document have an identical window: offset, number of points and
sweep-width. A spectrum selection list box is used to select one or more spectra. This
selection represents the spectra to be subtracted from all the spectra in the current
document. One or more spectra are selected by clicking on the labels. Clicking on a
selected spectrum will remove it from selection. If more than one spectra is selected,
then the average of the selected spectra will be used in the subtraction. Once the user
has made the selection of the spectra to be subtracted, the subtraction process is
initiated with the <b>Calculate</b> button:</P>

<TD width=18%>Calculate button</TD>

<TD width=82%>The button will subtract the selected spectra from all of the spectra in
the current document. If multiple spectra are selected, an average of the selected
spectra will be used for the subtraction. Once selected, the label of this button will
change to <b>Apply</b> and the button will appear to be in a pressed state. Pressing
the button again will apply the subtraction to the dataset. This operation may not be
able to be reversed. The subtraction process can be stopped by pressing the
<b>Cancel</b> button that only appears when the <b>Caluclate</b> button has been
pressed. There are two special cases:
<p>If there are only two spectrum in the current document and only one has been selected
for the subtraction operation, only the difference spectra will be shown after the calculate
button is pressed (while this button displays <b>Apply</b>), but once the <b>Apply</b>
is pressed the original two spectra will be retained and the difference will be shown.</p>
<p>If there is only one spectrum selected in the list box and the <b>scale</b> constant
is exactly 1.0, then the selected spectrum will be removed from the list of spectra once
the <b>Apply</b> button has been pressed. The subtraction will result in all zeros for
this spectrum, so there is no need to include it.</p></TD>

<td width=18%>Scale Slider</td>

<td width=82%>The scale slider is used to set a constant that the selected spectra are
scaled by before subtraction. Any real value can be used. Text input boxes (which only
accept real numbers) at the right and left of the slider are used to set the range of
the slider. The slider is divided into 101 steps so by adjusting the left and right
values, any real precision can be achieved. The default value of the slider range
is from 0.9 to 1.1.</td>
