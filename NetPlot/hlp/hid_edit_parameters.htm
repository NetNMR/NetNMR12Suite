<P>Use this command to show a dialog box that will allow you to modify the parameters used
to display and print the spectra.
</P>

<P>You can change the title displayed at the top of the page with the edit box at the top of this dialog.
</P>

<P>The controls in the Plot Range box specify which region of the spectra will be displayed.
The <a href="display_mode.htm">display mode</a> affects many other features in <i>NetPlot</i>.
If <b>None</b> is selected, the entire NMR data file will be displayed.  Please note that there will
be no axis drawn if <b>None</b> is selected.  If <b>Hertz</b> or <b>PPM</b> is selected, the From and To range of
the edit box will be populated with a range consistent with the data.  The From and To range
may be specified in the edit boxes.  You can specify ranges outside the range of any or all of
the current spectra.  In that case, an axis of the specified range will be shown and the data
from each spectrum will be properly referenced to that axis.  Just remember, if you specify a
<b>Hertz</b> or <b>PPM</b> range the data will be displayed accurately, according to each spectrum’s width
and offset.  If <b>None</b> is selected, the full range of each data set will be show and the axis
will not be displayed.
</P>

<P>The spectra size and relative offset is set with the controls in the <b>Spectrum Size and
Offset (cm)</b> box.  You can explicitly set these values or have <i>NetPlot</i> decide the best values
based on the current page layout and current number of spectra with the “Auto Arrange” button.
If the Y-offset is zero <i>NetPlot</i> will automatically offset the labels so that they will
not overlap. With zero Y-offset, you will probably want to <a href="hid_edit_colors.htm">assign
a unique color to each spectrum</a>.
</P>

<P>Each spectrum can be labeled with values taken from the flexible header using controls in
the <b>Label</b> dropdown.  You can use NetPlot’s sister application, <i>NetNMR</i>, to view, set, delete and
define values in the flexible header.  Once a flex header name is specified, its position relative
to the low right corner of a box containing the spectrum can be set.  The <b>Auto Arrange</b> button
will calculate a suggested position based on the current data files.
</P>

<P>If at least one spectrum is currently displayed, an <b>Auto Arrange</b> button will be visible.
Pressing this button will calculate optimal values for the spectrum Height and Width, Y Offset
(the X Offset will be zeroed) and label positions. The <b>Auto Arrange</b> command is also available
from the command bar.
</P>

<P>In local scaling mode (the default) minimum and maximum values for the range of data being
displayed will be used to scale each spectrum.  If the <a href="hid_view_global.htm">Global
Scaling</a> control is checked, the
union of the minima and maxima of all the spectra will be used to scale each spectrum.  Use
this control if you want to show relative intensity difference between spectra obtained under
similar conditions.
</P>

<P>The font size, in points (1/72 inch) can be specified for the title, labels and axis.
</P>

<P>The each spectrum can be individually scaled vertically by the
<a href="hid_process_yexpansion.htm">Y Expansion Factor</a> control.  Any data
values extending beyond the specified Height of the spectrum (when the Y Expansion Factor is
greater than 1.0) will be truncated to the spectrum height.
</P>

<p>The <a href="accelerator.htm">accelerator</a> for this command is Control+P.</p>
