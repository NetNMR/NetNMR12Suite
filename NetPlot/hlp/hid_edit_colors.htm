<BODY>

<P>Use this command to change the colors that are used to generate the <i>NetPlot</i> document.  Buttons
are available to quickly change the display color to white on a black background or
black on a white background.  When the display is <A href="hid_edit_copy.htm">copied
to the clipboard</A>, everything
but the background and the main and <a href="zoom_cursors.htm">zoom cursors</a>
are copied as displayed.</P>

<p>Because the colors for the main and zoom cursors are generated statically and these
colors depend on the backgound color, these cursors may not be displayed properly once
their colors (or the background color) are changed until NetPlot is restarted.</p>

<p>You can also control the colors of individual spectra from this dialog. You can
also easily change all the spectra to the same color. Spectrum labels will have the
same color as the spectra themselves.</p>

<P>For historical reasons, different color information is stored in different locations.
Spectrum colors are stored with the <i>NetPlot</i> document. All other colors, like the
title and axis colors, as well as the cursor and background colors are stored in the
Windows Registry. Any change in these Registry-stored colors immediately updates the
Registry. Because of this, it is possible to open a NetPlot document that was displaying
properly when it was saved and the
spectrum color saved with that document is identical to the current background color,
in which case it will be unobservable.</P>

<p>The <a href="accelerator.htm">accelerator</a> for this command is the Control+Shift+C.</p>
