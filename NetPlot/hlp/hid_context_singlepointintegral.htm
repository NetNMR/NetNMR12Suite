<p>Single Point Region Command (Context Menu)</p>

<p>A single point at the main cursor is added to the regions.</p>

<p>This command will only be active when the <a href="hid_integral_addintegral.htm">Add Region</a>
command is active.</p>

<p>Please note that if you mix and match broad integral regions with single point integrals,
subsequent data fitting in the resulting speadsheet built with the
<a href="hid_integral_fitintegrals.htm">Fit Integrals</a> command may be tricky because the integrals
from a single point can be very different from a broad integral region. This can make the "solver"
spreadsheet function work harder. In some cases individual curve should be solved one at a time.</p>
