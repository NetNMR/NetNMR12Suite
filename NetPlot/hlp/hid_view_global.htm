<p>This command will toggle the current NetPlot document between global scaling and local scaling.
Global scaling is a way to present spectra which were obtained under sufficiently identical conditions
so that intensities are comparable between spectra. Local scaling adjust each spectrum individually.
<i>NetPlot</i> always uses only the currently displayed region of each spectrum when calculating scaling
values. With global scaling, all spectra are examined within the current displayed region and the global
minimum and maximum are used to scale each point in each spectrum. With local scaling, the minimum and
maximum of current region of each spectrum is used to scale each point in that spectrum.</p>

<p>Local scaling is usually the approprate choice when comparing the spectra of different compounds. In
those cases where peaks in the current displayed region for one or a few of the spectra in the <i>NetPlot</i>
document obscure the display, the Y-scale of these individual spectra can be changed with the
<a href="hid_process_yexpansion.htm">Y-Expansion dialog</a>.</p>

<p>There are three places to control the global scaling toggle, the <a href="afx_hidw_toolbar.htm">toolbar</a>,
the <a href="menu_view.htm">View menu</a> and the <a href="hid_edit_parameters.htm">Parameters dialog</a>.</p>
