<P>Use this command to show a dialog box to allow you to add, remove and rearrange spectra in NetPlot.</P>

<P>Single click on an NMR Server in the upper left corner of this dialog and you will be connected to that
NMR Server.  This list box will always list “My Computer” along with other official NMR Servers to which you
have read access.   Single clicking on an NMR server will access that server and fill the directory list box
in the lower left of the dialog with the current directory contents from that server.  The current directory
for that server is displayed above the file list on the right side of the dialog.  Only directories (denoted
with a trailing “/” or “\”) and NMR data will be displayed in the “Directories and Files”
list box.</P>

<P>Double clicking on a directory in this list box will change the current directory for that server to that
directory and then refill the Directories and Files list box.  Double clicking on the first entry (“../” or
“..\”) will move up the directory tree.  When viewing “My Computer”, the “Drive:” dropdown list is enabled
and allows the current drive to be selected from a list of all available drive on the PC.  This includes mapped
network drives.  Double clicking on an NMR spectrum will add that file to the files list box on the right side
of the dialog.  Buttons below the files list box will allow you to remove and rearrange the list of files.
You must select a single file or a contiguous range of files
before you can move them up or down.  NMR files will be displayed, top to bottom, in the
same order as the files list box. A “Reverse All” button is there to quickly reverse the order of all the
added spectra.</P>

<P>Imported datasets that are arrays will be added as individual dataset.  Once the datasets have been imported
by clicking the “Okay” button this dialog may be executed again to reorder or edit the individual datasets.</P>

<p>Raw FID data can be imported, but not saved. Imported FID data must be transformed using the
<a href="hid_process_process.htm">Process dialog</a> and phased using the <a href="hid_process_phase.htm">Phase
dialog</a> before the NetPlot document is saved because the NetPlot document contains no imaginary data.</p>

<p>The <a href="accelerator.htm">accelerator</a> for this command is Control+A.</p>
