<P><A NAME="hid_file_addspectra"></A><B>AddSpecra command (File menu)</B></P>
<P>Use this command to add spectra to the current <EM>NetSpan</EM> document. The 
following dialog is displayed:</P>
<P><IMG alt="add spectra dialog" src="images/addspectra.gif"></P>
<P>The top of the dialog display the current directory. Below the current 
directory are four lists that are used for slecting spectra. The left most 
list is used to select an NMR server on the network, or you can select "My 
Computer" to use <EM>NetNMR</EM> *.NMR or *.NPL files. If you connect to "My 
Computer a list is visible to the immediate right to slect drives on your 
computer. These can be local and network drives. If an NMR server is 
selected, the drive list will not be visible.</P>
<P>The final two lists display the directories and NMR files in the current 
directory. Either double click on a directory or single-click and press the "Go 
To" button to move to that directory.</P>
<P>The you can select more than one file in the File dialog to open using the usual 
Windows methods for multiple selections: the Control key will allow you 
to add a single item to the selection and the Shift key will add a multiple 
inclusion to the current selection. After you select the files you need, click 
the "OK" button to add these files to current document. All added files 
must have the same spectral window (number of points, spectrometer frequency, sweep width and offset) 
and match any files already in the current document, otherwise they will be 
ignored. Keep in mind that multiple spectra may be added to the current 
document if the file being added is an arrayed file. In that case each 
sub-spectrum will be added to the current document.</P>
<P>Spectra name will be used as the label unless a header variable called "array" 
is defined and has a value that is the name of another defined header variable. 
In that case the value of that variable will be used as the label.
When importing <i>NetPlot</i> files, the <i>NetPlot</i> label will be used.</P>
