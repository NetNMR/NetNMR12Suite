			the new line, pressing the right mouse button and selecting "New Line 
			Here".&nbsp; NetSpan will initialize the line with best guesses of each 
			parameter. The height will be set to the height of each spectrum at the cursor 
			position. The shape will be set to 50% Lorentzian and the width will be set to 
			the minimum value where the difference spectrum falls to half of the intensity 
			(in the spectrum with the largest height).</P>
