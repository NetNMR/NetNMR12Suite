			This Dialog is used to manage spectra in the current document.</P>
		<P><IMG alt="spectra dialog" src="images/spectra.gif"></P>
		<P>Click on a spectrum label and you can move the selected spectra up or down, 
			change the spectrum label or delete the spectrum from the current document. 
			You can select multiple spectra using the usual keyboard modifiers. (Select the
			first of a contiguous range of spectra by clicking on the first and then holding the
			Shift key and clicking on the last item in the range. The Control key can be
			used to add or remove a single item to the selection.)</P>
		<P>You can only move spectra up or down if you have selected a single, contiguous range of spectra
		    in the list. Any gaps in the selection will turn the <B>Move Up</B> and <B>Move Down</B>
		    buttons off. With any selection of spectra, contiguous or not, where at least one item is selected
		    the <b>Remove</b> button is enabled. You can only <b>Rename</b> single selections.</P>
		<P>Deleting all spectra in the current document will cause this dialog to 
			disappear.</P>
		<p>You can control which spectra are displayed. If you have more than 8 spectra, click on
		    a radio button in the &quot;View&quot; group box to display the desired spectra.</p>
