		<P>This dialog is used to fit the lines to the spectra in the current document.</P>
		<P><IMG alt="fit dialog" src="images/fit.gif"></P>
		<P>The Fit dialog is used to automatically (using an iterative non-linear least 
			squares or downhill simplex) optimize line parameters to minumize standard error
			of the fit. While least-squares is generally faster, it is more prone to blowing
			up. During the iterations, a parameter correction will become too large because
			of the non-linear line functions and the current solution will be moved to a
			place in parameter space where it cannot recover. In this case, the residual error
			will increase, sometimes dramatically. Another problem with least squares is that
			sometimes the optimization will oscillate between two or three solutions and so
			will never reach the required tolerance. Downhill simplex will find at
			least a local minimum, as long as enough iterations are preformed. Residual errors
			will never increase during a simplex optimization. Downhill dimplex will usually
			take many iterations to find that minimum.</P>
		<p>When the method is switched between least squares and simplex, the iteration maximum
		    will be automatically adjusted to 100 or 100,000 respectively. If the iteration
		    count has been exceded you can restart the optimization. This would only make
		    sense if the previous attempt looked promising. Please note that no parameter errors
		    will be calculated if performing a simplex optimization. After a sucessful simplex
		    optimization, least squares optimiation can then be applied to solution if you
		    need parameter errors. In this case, it would be a good idea to save the solution
		    after the simplex optimization, just in case the least squares optimization blows
		    up.</p>
		<P>	
			All the 
			line shapes can be forced to 100% Lorentzian or 100% Gaussian with the check 
			boxes. The Lineshape Reset button will return all lineshapes to 50% Lorentzian 
			and enable their optimizations. If during the optimization process <EM>NetSpan</EM>
			calculated a lineshape to have 0% or 100% Lorentzian, that lineshape will 
			no longer be enabled in the optimization process. No statistical error will be 
			listed for this lineshape in the output.</P>
		<P>Baselines for each spectrum can have one (simple DC level) to four (cubic 
			polynomial) parameters. Chose "1" or "2" if NMR lines occupy a large fraction 
			of the current region. Only use "3" or "4" if there is obvious curvature in the 
			baseline, otherwise calculated peak heights may be compromised. The calculated 
			baseline coefficients have no intrinsic value to the simulation and are not 
			displayed in the output.</P>
		<P>The optimization limits are set in the "Tolerance" and "Iterations" edit items. 
			Tolerance is the fraction of change in the standard error with each 
			iteration. The value shown is usually appropriate for most data. For well 
			behaved data using the least-squares method, optimization is usually achieved
			in 25 iterations or less. For Simplex, optimization will typically require
			tens of thousands of iterations. In 
			some cases the tolerance will not be achieved within the specified number of 
			iterations and a error dialog will be displayed.</P>
		<P>Upon sucessful optimization, a dialog will be displayed that shows the optimized 
			parameters with errors (for a least squares fit). The user can then print these results, copy the text to 
			the clipboard, or launch an different programs that can fit the integrals to one of 
			several relaxation functions. Excel&reg; can be used to fit simple single or double
			exponentials. More complex analysis can be performed by inverse LaPlace transform using
			the NetNMR Application Suite program <i>ILT</i>.
			Since these fitting programs are designed to fit
			integral intensities, the button to launch the analysis programs will only be enabled
			if you are fitting at least four spectra.
