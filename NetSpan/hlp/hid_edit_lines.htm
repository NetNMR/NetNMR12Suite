		<P>This dialog is used to manage the lines in the current document.</P>
		<P><IMG alt="lines dialog" src="images/lines.gif"></P>
		<P>Lines can be selected in the drop down list. The line name can be changed from 
			the default "Line X" where X is a number. The line can also be deleted. Once a 
			line has been selected, the shape (% Lorentzian), width and shift is displayed. 
			The optimization of any of these line parameters can be disabled by unchecking 
			the parameter for that line.</P>
		<P>The values of these parameters can be tweaked in many ways. Edit the value in 
			the edit box (the display will not be updated until the edit box has lost focus 
			by pressing the &lt;Tab&gt; key or clicking on another control in the 
			dialog. You can also grab the slider handle with a mouse click and 
			just drag the ajacent to the disired value. While dragging the slider 
			handle, the parameter value will be similtaneously updated. For a more 
			controlled adjustment, click on the horizontal slider "wire" to the left or 
			right of the slider handle and the parameter will change ~1%. Hold 
			the mouse button down for continous, incremental adjustment. The 
			finest adjustment of about 0.1% can be controlled with the arrow cursor keys. 
			Again, hold the arrow key down for continous, incremental adjustment.</P>
		<P>Lines can be added to the current document with the <A href="menu_context.htm">context 
				menu</A>.</P>
