		<P>This will copy the current line parameters (as text) to the clipboard. The 
			values will be delimited (separated) by tabs, facilitating copying the 
			clipboard into a spreadsheet. In addition to lines listing the intensities, 
			shape, width and shifts, there are lines that also list the integrated 
			intensities of each line. Line integrals are calculated by multiplying the peak 
			height and width and a factor related to the shape. Since only the line 
			parameters are copied, there must be at least one spectrum and one line in the 
			current doucment.</P>
